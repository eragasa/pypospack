This folder contains the simulation script which utilizes a custom machine learning algorithm to evolve the set of Pareto optimal results by partitioning the parameter space using manifold learning and clustering techniques.

CONTENTS:
=========

run__iterative_cluster_sampling.py - this is a python script which is run by MPI to conduct all the simulations based upon the contents in the data directory
runjob_hipergator.sh - is an example SLURM script for the library

data/
    |-> pyposmat.kde.0.out, contains a file with the initial candidate population
    |-> Ni__eam__born_exp_fs.py, is the python script which creates the configuration file: pyposmat.config.in


INSTRUCTIONS:
=============

1.  Create the configuration file.
    cd data
    python Ni__eam__born_exp_fs.py
    cd ../
2.  Run the simulations.  The simulations require the pypospack library which should be in $PYTHONPATH/pypospack as well as all the dependencies for the pypospack library.

RESULTS:
========
1.  Based on the number of processors, there will be a number of 'rank_<rank_number>' folders.  These are temporary folders which are used for concurrency between processors.  They do not contain any data which is important
2.  The 'data' folder will have a variety of files which contain the results:  pyposmat.kde.*.out pyposmat.results.*.out pyposmat.cluster.*.out
3.  pyposmat.log contains a log from the simulations which is contained in the root simulation directory.

KNOWN ISSUES:
=============

There is a current MPI bug which will cause the MPI manager to panic.  This problem has not been resolved.

REVISIONS:
==========
2018-08-28:  Initial release.  EJR/RSU
