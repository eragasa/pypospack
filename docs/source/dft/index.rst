Density Functional Theory
=========================

The purpose of this page is to provide some introduction and a place to get more information.  As I write my dissertation, I will begin to slowly increase the amount of information provided, include both references, manuscripts, and some tutorials.  I have found that the introduction to DFT has been somewhat frustrating when I started by graduate career because much of the theory is confusing, which might be surprising to some because I have a background in mathematics before getting into computational materials science.
