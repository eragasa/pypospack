Calculation of intrinsic stacking fault energies
------------------------------------------------

Notes from this section are fro Chandran and Sondhi :cite:`chandran2001_Ni_sf`.

The [111] intrinsic stacking fault (ISF) in the fcc structure is created by removing one layer, which changes the sequence from ABCA to ABCB. 
The :math:`\gamma_{ISF}` is formally defined as 

.. math::

   \gamma_{ISF} = \frac{1}{A}(F_{ISF} - F)

where :math:`F_{ISF}` and :math:`F` are the free-energies of the structure with and without a stacking fault, respectively, and :math:`A` is the area of the faulted region.  When these calculations are done at :math:`T=0`, the free energies and be replaces with :math:`E_{ISF}` and :math:`E`.

The energies :math:`E_{ISF}` and :math:`E` can be calculated using first-principle methods using the supercell method.
