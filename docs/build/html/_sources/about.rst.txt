Raman Spectra Simulation (Unpublished work)
-------------------------------------------
The effect of anion intrinsic defects of Raman spectra on fluorite-structure materials with a particular focus on CaF2, CeO2, and UO2.  Since CeO2 and UO2 require DFT+U corrections perturbational methods aren't available to calculate Raman signatures.  Instead the derivatives of the polarization tensor is calculated through the application of finite electric fields.  DFT+U has the problem of creating metastable states which need to be resolved to find the ground state energy requiring the use of techniques such as occupation matrix control, +U ramping, and annealing.  The value of this research for experimental researchers to resolve changes in Raman signatures to particular point defects.  For computational scientists, this research will also explore techniques for resolving metastable states to the ground state, particuarly with the application of an electric field to the calculations.
