Knowledge of the geometrical arrangement of the atoms near the surface is a basic ingredient for the study of structural and dynamic properties of a metal surface.  In the surface geometry, surface tension and stress play important roles in determining whether and how surfaces reconstruct and relax.

Cosider the atoms in the bulk and surface regions of a crytal.  In the bulk, atoms possess lower energy because they are tightly bound.  At the surface, the atoms posess higher energy because they are less tightly bound.  The sum of all the excess energies of the surface atoms is the surface energy.
