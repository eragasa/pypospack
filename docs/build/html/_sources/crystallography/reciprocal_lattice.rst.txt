Reciprocal Lattice
==================

The reciprocal lattice represents the Fourier transform of another lattice from real space into the momentum.

Pontryagin Duality
------------------

In harmonic analysis and theory of topological groups,  Pontrygin duality explains the general properties of 
the Fourier transform on locally compact grousp.
