Crystallography
===============

Crystallography deals with the arrangement of atoms in a crystaline solid.
The approach to crystallography provided aimed toward computational materials.
Since computational materials often require the development of computer codes, the approach provided includes what I feel is an appropriate mathematical approach.

Stacking Faults
---------------
A stacking fault is a type of defect which characterizes the disordering of crystallographic planes.

The stacking fault energy (SFE) is a fundamental parameter in the design of alloys.
It has a large impact on the creep properties of materials in temperature and stress ranges where dominant deformation is by dislocation glide.  Low SFE leads to a large separation between Shockley dislocation which hinders cross-slip and thereby effectively reduces the creep rate.
