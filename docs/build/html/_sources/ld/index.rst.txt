Lattice Dynamics
################

Two frequency-domain methods for predicting phonon frequencies and lifetimes using phonon spectral energy density can be described.

One comes from lattice dynamics.

        
For a perfect lattice, all vibrational modes are phonon modes, which by definition are delocalized, propagating plane waves.
