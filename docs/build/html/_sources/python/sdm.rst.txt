Software Development Model
==========================

Application to Scientific Software Development for Research
===========================================================

* Developers are usually subject matter experts, but not software developers.
* Software need is utilitarian and short development timeframes due to funding issues
* Research codebase is constantly changing due to solving new problems.
* High-value in code which is usable by external members, and extensible for external members 

The question is how to develop high-quality code suitable for external consumption, but also have a code base which can be quickly developed.  For the development of a new codebase, we should look at processes developed in existing software development lifecycle projects, and identify the systematic problems 

Waterfall
=========

* Requirements analysis.
* System design.
* Implementation
* Testing
* Maintenance

Waterfall development methodologies helps developers be more managable.  It's an easily understood process which is easy to understand.  Errors are detected early, and is suitable when development team members are located in different places

This type of software development model requires an experienced development staff.  In particular, it requires expert developers at the system design level.  When the requirements of the projects are changing, since the process needs to be started again when there are any changes.

Rapid Application Development
=============================

* Planning
* Analysis
* Design
* Build
* Test
* Deploy

The analysis, design, build, and test phases are run iteratively.  It focuses on prototyping.  Easy of implementation.  Improved user satifaction.  Shorter time to market.

Speed of development may lead to a poorly designed product.  Needs experienced development staff.  Strong project management and control necessary (Coleman and Verbruggen 2008)
