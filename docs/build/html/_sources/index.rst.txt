Materials Ex Machina
####################

Deus Ex Machina. (1) a Latin phrase originally described an ancient plot device used in Greek and Roman theatre to resolve complicated or even hopeless situations in the plots of their plays. Literally means "god from the machine", (2) a person or thing that appears or is introduced suddenly and unexpectedly and provides a contrived solution to an insoluble difficulty.

Materials Ex Machina represents the current state of computational materials science in a variety of different ways.  Certain tools such as Density Functional Theory are being used as exhaustive search tools for finding new materials from techniques generally referred to as in silico high-throughput computing.  Computational searches for optimal alloys using tools such as AT-AT provide impetus for a computational driven approach to new materials design.  

Computational material science is also a difficult field because much of the information to do high quality simulations simply does not exist, and approaches to creating high quality simulations is usually not documented in peer-reviewed journal articles, tutorials usually only cover trivial material problems, and reference textbooks concentrate on theory rather the ability to do useful simulations.

Within this corner of the Internet, I'm posting a variety of different notes and manuscripts distilled from a variety of notes from the University of Florida.  These notes are combined from classes, research, personal projects, and personal interests.  My research is currently in computational materials science, and these online notes began when I started my doctoral program, but I'm consolidating the notes I'm using for my dissertation and code documentation here.

My research is focused on the use of the following tools:

* :ref:`Density Functional Theory. <dft>`

* :ref:`Molecular Dynamics. <md>`

* :ref:`Lattice Dynamics. <ld>`
